Final SelectioN:

l_pt>35
PU, ID, ISO and Trigger corrections are applied. 

======================================================================

Below part for Pre-Selection:
=======	Electron Selection	==========================================
Trigger:	HLT_Ele27_eta2p1_WPLoose_Gsf_v
=> Choose highest pT electrons that passes the following cuts:
	=>	Cut based Tight ID
	=>	pT > 30 GeV
	=>	|𝜂| < 2.1

======================================================================
=======	Muon Selection		==========================================
Trigger:	HLT_IsoMu22_v
=> Choose highest pT muon that passes following cuts:
	=>	Tight ID
	=>	trkIso/pT < 0.1
	=>	pT > 25 GeV
	=>	|𝜂| < 2.4

======================================================================
=======	MET Selection		==========================================
=>	pfMET with Type 1 Corrections.


======================================================================
=======	General Jet Selection	======================================
=>	JEC applied: L1, L2, L3, and L2L3
=>	pT > 30 GeV
=>	|𝜂| < 2.4
=>	Jets cleaned from lepton: ΔR > 0.3
=>	Should have atleast 4 jets

**** Below VBF and Wjets selection was done and branches were saved but
	no cut is applied at pre-selection level.
======================================================================
======	VBF Jet Selection	==========================================
=>	VBF Tagging
	=>	Delta eta > 3.5
	=>	M(jj) > 500
	=>	Eta1 * Eta2 < 0
	=>	If more than one pair found, choose the one with maximum delta eta.

======================================================================
======	W-jet Selection		==========================================
=>	Choose highest PT jets from remaining ones as W jets.
